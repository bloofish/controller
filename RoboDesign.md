# Requirements
*Identifying the purpose of construction and any specific requirements.*  
Goal: To design and build a simple remotely controlled robot.  
Requirements: Basic movement/turining on carpet and hard flooring, camera to stream to user, battery powered, audio input/output.

# Research and Design
*Gathering information, selecting components and designing structure.*  

Raspberry pi:  
Already got it lmao gottem.  

Motor controller: 
L298N: Popular h-bridge with many guides, screw/pin input output(no breadboard).  
L293D: Smaller, cheaper, requires breadboard.

Camera:
5MP Camera for Raspberry Pi: cheap, built for Raspbian, decent quality.

Motor:
6V YM2712: Battery output only 5V but should be fine.  
12V YM2716: Voltage too high for battery output.

Battery:
Rechargable hobby battery:   
Power bank: 2x 5V 2000mA output (2.4A max)  

# Prototyping and Construction
*Testing, troubleshooting and building.* 

# Programing
*Integration with controller.*
